# Variables

## Scope

The following presents a standardised way for naming variables and their response options, specifically arising from questionnaires and surveys.

## Definition

We agreed to use the following conventions for demographic variables and answer possibilities and the for the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) (10 is optional):

The option "Prefer not to say" is always the last option in single choice answers.
The option "Not collected" is not provided as a choice to select, this is an internal coding.
* For Perferred Language the following Note has to be added to the Question:
"Note: If you do not prefer either of the languages, you are not eligible for the study.
       This means you can not participate in the study."
